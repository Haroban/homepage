            	<h4>Iolani Palace</h4>
                <h1>Hawaiian Kingdom built by King David</h1>
                <p>A national historic landmark and the only official state residence of royalty in the United States, Downtown Honolulu's Iolani Palace was the official residence of the Hawaiian Kingdom's last two monarchs from 1882 to 1893: 
                   King Kalakaua and his sister and successor, Queen Liliuokalani. <br />
                   <br />
                   The palace was a symbol of promise for the Hawaiian Kingdom built by King David Kalakaua, "The Merrie Monarch." Influenced by European architectural styles, 
                   this royal residence included Hawaii's first electric light system, flush toilets and intra-house telephones. <br />
				   <br />
                   The rich interior features a beautiful koa staircase, dramatic portraits of Hawaiian royalty, ornate furniture and royal gifts and ornaments from around the world. 
                   In 1893, a provisional U.S. government was established after opposition forces overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy. The Hawaiian Islands were eventually annexed as a United States Territory in 1898. 
                   Hawaii became the 50th state in 1959 and during this time Iolani Palace was used as the capitol building until 1968. 
                   After falling into disrepair over the years, the Iolani Palace was opened to the public in 1978 after an extensive renovation. </p>

                <h1>KÄ«lauea active volcano</h1>
                <p>Watch the landscape change before your very eyes at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Located 30 miles southwest of Hilo, 
				   this is the home of Kilauea volcano, one of the most active volcanoes on earth. 
				   The chance to witness the primal process of creation and destruction make this park one of the most popular visitor attraction in Hawaii and a sacred place for Native Hawaiians.<br />
                   <br />
                   Founded in 1916, the Park encompasses 333,000 acres from the summit of Maunaloa to the sea. Here you'll find 150 miles of hiking trails through volcanic craters, 
                   scalded deserts and rainforests as well as a museum, petroglyphs, a walk-in lava tube and two active volcanoes: Maunaloa, which last erupted in 1984 and Kilauea which has been erupting since January 3rd, 1983. 
                   The extraordinary natural diversity of the park was recognized in 1980 when it was named a World Biosphere site by UNESCO and in 1987 when the park was again honored as a World Heritage site.</p>
