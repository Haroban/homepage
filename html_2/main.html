            <p>Snorkeling Hawaii is what opened our hearts to the fantastic beauty of the underwater world, and the joy of floating on warm tropical waters. <br />
                And we have snorkeled the dickens out of Hawaii in the last ten years. This is true tropical snorkeling bliss. <br />
                Beautiful beaches, perfect weather and water and fun boat tours. <br />
                In Hawaii you are primarily snorkeling fringing reefs, made up of varieties of hard corals. <br /> 
                Very often this means snorkeling around the rocky exposed points between beaches, instead of inside protected bays.</p>

                    You have not made it as a world class surfer <br />
                    if you have not made it on the North Shore. <br />
                    Look in any international surfing magazine and <br />

                    It is a place truly blessed with powerful swells <br />

                <p>Driving in Hawaii is relatively straightforward as roads are well signed <br />
                    and in good condition, particularly on the island of Oahu. <br />
                    Home to the tourist mecca of Honolulu, <br />
                    Oahu's roads are the busiest and as such <br />
                    you'll find several freeways here <br />
                    as well as the most developed roads in Hawaii.<br /> 
                    Just like in mainland America, <br />
                    Hawaiians drive on the right hand side of the road <br />
                    and speed limits are expressed in miles per hour.</p>

                <p>Kīlauea is a currently active shield volcano in the Hawaiian Islands, and the most active of the five volcanoes that together form the island of Hawaii. 
                   Located along the southern shore of the island, the volcano is between 300,000 and 600,000 years old and emerged above sea level about 100,000 years ago. 
                   It is the second youngest product of the Hawaiian hotspot and the current eruptive center of the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. 
                   Because it lacks topographic prominence and its activities historically coincided with those of Mauna Loa, Kīlauea was once thought to be a satellite of its much larger neighbor. </p>
